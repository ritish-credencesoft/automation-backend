## Automation Onboarding

###  Description

Onboarding Automation was required for our software to  automate our onboarding process by which we can reduce the number of administrative work hours.From the beginning we are entering  properties data manually at the time of onboarding.This process is divided by several steps which takes more than 1 hours or 2 hours (Depending upon the propertyâ€™s data).
By automation process we can enter those data in some seconds only.We write scripts in Python.to automate the whole process.By using the Request Module in python we send post requests and get requests to our APIs  and complete the process.By using for loop we can automate multiple number of data at a time.Our properties data are stored in JSON format.Our python script will read the data from JSON and send request to our server.
